"Surabhi Sinha, Sophia I. Thomopoulos, Pradeep Lam, Alexandra Muir, Paul M. Thompson",Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Accuracy is Improved by MRI Harmonization based on Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for 60% of dementia cases worldwide; patients with the disease typically suffer from irreversible memory loss and progressive decline in multiple cognitive domains. With brain imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), microscopic brain changes are detectable even before abnormal memory loss is detected clinically. Patterns of brain atrophy can be measured using MRI, which gives us an opportunity to facilitate AD detection using image classification techniques. Even so, MRI scanning protocols and scanners differ across studies. The resulting differences in image contrast and signal to noise make it important to train and test classification models on multiple datasets, and to handle shifts in image characteristics across protocols (also known as domain transfer or domain adaptation). Here, we examined whether adversarial domain adaptation can boost the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify AD. To test this, we used an Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to harmonize images from three publicly available brain MRI datasets - ADNI, AIBL and OASIS - adjusting for scanner-dependent effects. Our AG-GAN optimized a joint objective function that included attention loss, pixel loss, cycle-consistency loss and adversarial loss; the model was trained bidirectionally in an end-to-end fashion. For AD classification, we adapted the popular 2D AlexNet CNN to handle 3D images. Classification based on harmonized MR images significantly outperformed classification based on the three datasets in non-harmonized form, motivating further work on image harmonization using adversarial techniques.

Lam, Paul Thompson, Jose Luis Ambite, Greg Ver Steeg",Membership Inference Attacks on Deep Regression Models for Neuroimaging,"Ensuring the privacy of research participants is vital, even more so in healthcare environments. Deep learning approaches to neuroimaging require large datasets, and this often necessitates sharing data between multiple sites, which is antithetical to the privacy objectives. Federated learning is a commonly proposed solution to this problem. It circumvents the need for data sharing by sharing parameters during the training process. However, we demonstrate that allowing access to parameters may leak private information even if data is never directly shared. In particular, we show that it is possible to infer if a sample was used to train the model given only access to the model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box) and some leaked samples from the training data distribution. Such attacks are commonly referred to as \textit{Membership Inference attacks}. We show realistic Membership Inference attacks on deep learning models trained for 3D neuroimaging tasks in a centralized as well as decentralized setup. We demonstrate feasible attacks on brain age prediction models (deep learning models that predict a person's age from their brain MRI scan). We correctly identified whether an MRI scan was used in model training with a 60% to over 80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions.","Ensuring privacy in healthcare research is crucial, and federated learning has been proposed as a solution for deep learning approaches to neuroimaging.

Scaling Neuroscience Research Using Federated Learning","The amount of biomedical data continues to grow rapidly. However, the ability to analyze these data is limited due to privacy and regulatory concerns. Machine learning approaches
that require data to be copied to a single location are hampered by the challenges of data sharing. Federated Learning
is a promising approach to learn a joint model over data silos.
This architecture does not share any subject data across sites,
only aggregated parameters, often in encrypted environments,
thus satisfying privacy and regulatory requirements. Here,
we describe our Federated Learning architecture and training
policies. We demonstrate our approach on a brain age prediction model on structural MRI scans distributed across multiple sites with diverse amounts of data and subject (age) distributions. In these heterogeneous environments, our SemiSynchronous protocol provides faster convergence.","The growth of biomedical data is limited by privacy and regulatory concerns.

Building on a 3D convolutional neural network, we added two attention modules at different layers of abstraction, so that features learned are spatially related to the global features for the task. The attention layers allow the network to focus on brain regions relevant to the task, while masking out irrelevant or noisy regions. In evaluations based on 4,561 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scans from 4 phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), salience maps for age and AD prediction partially overlapped, but lower-level features overlapped more than higher-level features. The brain age prediction network also distinguished AD and healthy control groups better than another state-of-the-art method. The resulting visual analyses can distinguish interpretable feature patterns that are important for predicting clinical diagnosis. Future work is needed to test performance across scanners and populations.","Researchers developed an interpretable 3D Grid-Attention neural network that accurately predicts a person's age and Alzheimer's disease status using structural brain MRI scans.

Thompson",Accurate brain age prediction using recurrent slice-based networks,"BrainAge (a subject’s apparent age predicted from neuroimaging data) is an important biomarker of brain aging. The deviation of BrainAge from true age has been associated with psychiatric and neurological disease, and has proven effective in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Conventionally, 3D convolutional neural networks and their variants are used for brain age prediction. However, these networks have a larger number of parameters and take longer to train than their 2D counterparts. Here we propose a 2D slice-based recurrent neural network model, which takes in an ordered sequence of sagittal slices as input to predict the brain age. The model consists of two components: a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN), which encodes the relevant features from the slices, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns the relationship between slices. We compare our method to other recently proposed methods, including 3D deep convolutional regression networks, information theoretic models, and bag-of-features (BoF) models (such as BagNet) - where the classification is based on the occurrences of local features, without taking into consideration their global spatial ordering. In our experiments, our proposed model performs comparably to, or better than, the current state of the art models, with nearly half the number of parameters and a lower convergence time.","BrainAge, an important biomarker of brain aging, can be predicted from neuroimaging data using a 2D slice-based recurrent neural network model.

As new AD treatments begin to be developed, one key goal of AD research is to predict which individuals with MCI are most likely to progress to AD over a given interval (such as 2 years); if successful, these individuals could be preferentially enrolled in drug trials that aim to slow AD progression. Here we benchmarked a range of MCI-to-AD predictive models including linear regressions, support vector machines, and random forests, using predictors from anatomical and diffusion-weighted brain MRI, age, sex, APOE genotype and standardized clinical scores.

We propose a robust dimensionality reduction framework for tractography, using a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConvVAE) to learn low-dimensional embeddings from white matter bundles. The resulting embeddings can be used to facilitate downstream tasks such as outlier and abnormality detection, and mapping of disease effects on white matter tracts in individuals or groups. We design experiments to evaluate how well embeddings of different dimensions preserve distances from the original high-dimensional dataset, using distance correlation methods. We find that streamline distances and inter-bundle distances are well preserved in the latent space, with a 6-dimensional optimal embedding space. The generative ConvVAE model allows fast inference on new data, and the smooth latent space enables meaningful decodings that can be used for downstream tasks. We demonstrate the use of a ConvVAE model trained on control subjects’ data to detect structural anomalies in white matter tracts in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
